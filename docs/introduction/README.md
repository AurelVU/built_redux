# Introduction

The reasons for using redux in dart are the same as js. If you are trying to decide if your app needs redux I suggest starting by reading [Dan Abramov's motivation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation).
This contents of this section will further elaborate on the principles of redux, how built_redux differs from [redux.dart](https://github.com/johnpryan/redux.dart), and explain why you may choose built_redux over redux.dart.
